Many species communicate by combining signals into multimodal combinations. Elephants live in multi-level societies where individuals regularly separate and reunite. Upon reunion, elephants often engage in elaborate greeting rituals where they use signals produced with different articulators and of various sensory modalities. We studied separation-reunion events to explore multimodal communication in the greeting behaviour of semi-captive elephants (Loxodonta africana). We applied Linear Mixed Models and Collocation Analyses to investigate whether elephants direct silent-visual, audible, and tactile gestures at their audience based on their attentional state and how they combine these gestures with vocalisations in multicomponent combinations. We show that elephants select gesture modality according to the audience´s visual attention, indicating evidence of first-order intentional use. We further show that elephants incorporate vocalisations and gestures in different combinations and orders. The most frequent combination was of rumble vocalisations with ear-flapping gestures, used most often between females. By showing that a species evolutionarily distant to our own primate lineage shows sensitivity to their audience’s visual attention in their gesturing and combines gestures with vocalisations, our study advances our understanding of the emergence of first-order intentionality and multicomponent signalling across taxa.
